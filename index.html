    <h1>Privacy Policy for Home Automation Skill</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [21/09/2024]</p>
    <p>This privacy policy outlines how Home Automation Skill (the "Skill") collects, uses, and protects your information during the interaction between Amazon Alexa, Home Assistant, and Keycloak for authentication purposes.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alexa User ID</strong>: A unique identifier provided by Alexa to link your account to the Skill.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth Tokens</strong>: These tokens are issued by your Keycloak authentication server to allow secure access to your Home Assistant setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Interaction Data</strong>: Information related to the commands you give Alexa and the devices in your home that are controlled by the Skill.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate and securely link your Alexa device to your Home Assistant system.</li>
        <li>Control and automate your smart home devices based on your Alexa commands.</li>
        <li>Ensure seamless integration between Alexa and Home Assistant through secure OAuth 2.0 authentication provided by Keycloak.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. The Skill uses encrypted communication (via HTTPS) to exchange OAuth tokens and access Home Assistant. No sensitive data is stored permanently, and all tokens are securely handled and encrypted.</p>
    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your personal information, including authentication tokens and device data, is <strong>not shared</strong> with any third parties except in the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> If required by law or government authorities, we may disclose necessary information.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Maintenance:</strong> If required to maintain, enhance, or troubleshoot the Skill, access may be granted to trusted service providers with appropriate safeguards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your authentication tokens are retained only as long as necessary for the Skill to function. Tokens are refreshed periodically, and any expired or unnecessary tokens are deleted securely.</p>
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may revoke the Skill's access to your Home Assistant account at any time by disabling the Skill in the Alexa app or revoking permissions via Keycloak.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
